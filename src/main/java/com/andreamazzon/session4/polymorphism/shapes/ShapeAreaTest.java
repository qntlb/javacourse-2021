/**
 * In this test we show an example of polymorphism. We have an array of shapes and we ask to each member of this
 * array to call the method computing its area. However, until run time we don't know if the members are
 * circles, squares or triangles, as they are selected randomly. However, we are able to do this because
 * the objects of the derived classes get upcasted to the base type when they are created (see the method
 * nextShape() of RandomShapeGenerator). Every object is then treated as a Shape in the array at compilation
 * time, but at run time its special type is recognized and the specific implementation of the method
 * computeArea() is called. This behavior is known as late binding: the code being called isnâ€™t determined
 * until run time
