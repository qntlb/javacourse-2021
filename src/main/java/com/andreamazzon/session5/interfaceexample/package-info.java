/**
 * In this package we illustrate a first example of interface: and interface is a "completely abstract"
 * class, as it only gives the returning type, name and arguments lists of the methods that a class
 * "implementing" that interface must implement, and possibly final, static fields: it provides the
 * "form" of a class implementing that interface, but not the implementation.
