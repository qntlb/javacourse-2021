/**
 * In this test we show an example of polymorphism and use of abstract classes.
 * We have an array of objects of type Shape, and we ask to each member of this
 * array to call the method computing its area. This might be surprising at a
 * first glance, because we know that we cannot have objects whose specific type
 * if Shape! Indeed, until run time we don't know the specific type of the
 * objects. However, we are able to do this because the objects of the derived
 * classes get upcasted to the base type when they are created (see the method
 * nextShape() of RandomShapeGenerator). Every object is then treated as a
 * general Shape in the array at compilation time, but at run time its special
 * type is recognized and the specific implementation of the method
 * computeArea() is called. This behavior is known as late binding: the code
 * being called isnâ€™t determined until run time
